>Bootstrap method with heuristic search:
>  Number of bootstrap replicates = 100
>  Starting seed = 1207922350
>  Number of characters resampled in each replicate = 868
>  Optimality criterion = parsimony
>    Character-status summary:
>      Of 868 total characters:
>        All characters are of type 'unord'
>        All characters have equal weight
>        600 characters are constant
>        93 variable characters are parsimony-uninformative
>        Number of parsimony-informative characters = 175
>    Gaps are treated as "missing"
>    Multistate taxa interpreted as uncertainty
>  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
>    Addition sequence: simple (reference taxon = gi|405795385|gb|JX564707.1|)
>    Number of trees held at each step = 1
>  Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) with reconnection limit = 8
>    Steepest descent option not in effect
>  Initial 'Maxtrees' setting = 100
>  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if maximum branch length is zero
>  'MulTrees' option in effect
>  No topological constraints in effect
>  Trees are unrooted
>
>  100 bootstrap replicates completed
>  Note: Effectiveness of search may have been diminished due to tree-buffer overflow.
